## Key Features
1.User Authentication: Sign-up and login functionality (register new users, login, session management). 

2.Home Page : A public home page listing blog posts or giving navigation for login/register. 

3.User Profile: Each user has a profile (with profile picture and details). There is UI to display profile details — implemented using Bootstrap modal. 

4.Blog / Posts Module: Users (after login) can create new blog posts, view existing posts, maybe update or delete (CRUD for blog content). The series aims at building a “blogging system project using Java servlet and JSP.” 

5.Front-end UI: Use of JSP (JavaServer Pages) for rendering dynamic pages, HTML + perhaps CSS / Bootstrap (since profile uses Bootstrap modal) for frontend layout. 

6.Project Structure & Resources Management: At the start, the tutorial covers how to set up a Java project properly (with right resource management) to make the project maintainable and modular.
